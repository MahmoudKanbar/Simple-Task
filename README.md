# Notes
I tried not to use any built-in physics or compenents from Unity, It's all have been built through basic mathematic operations to gain more controle over the player movement. </br>
The sphere that has been used for the earth mesh is not perfectlly round so when the player move to the equator he will be like floating a little bit. </br>
There is some viberation when correcting the player transform.up, Witch unfortunately I couldn't find a way to fix it. </br>
Tested On Unity 2020.32f1 </br>
