# Notes
I tried not to use any built-in physics or components from Unity, It's all have been built through basic mathematic operations to gain more controls over the player movement. </br>
The sphere that has been used for the earth mesh is not perfectly round so when the player move to the equator he will be like floating a little bit. </br>
There is some vibration when correcting the player transform.up, Witch unfortunately I couldn't find a way to fix it, But I'm sure if I gave it more time I will be able to solve it. </br>
Tested On Unity 2020.32f1 </br>
